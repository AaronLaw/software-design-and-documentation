===================

 * 2 sections combined because larger classes are better pedagogy.
 * Syllabus is a contract [of adhesion].
 * Documentation

   * **UML** - graphical language
   * "Vision statements" (drug induced?)
 * Software Design

   * Design patterns (GoF?)
 * "Agile form of the unified process" (para ingles?)
 * See the syllabus for a list of worst practices (they're mislabeled as best
   practices, not sure why).
 * Ruby on Rails is an object oriented language. (At this point your eyes
   should be bloodshot).
