====================

Third class session, second I've attended.  Second official class was missed
due to DjangoCon.

Doing pitches for class projects, I gave one in the first class on a "package
status" website for PyPy:

* Something for tracking fraternity rush students.

  * PHP
* Tournament management program, for gaming club
* Web app for new bands to connect with club owners and fans
* making a new graphical programming language

Now picking groups for projects.

Group selected:

Going to build a room management system for the campus. jQuery + Django,
PostgreSQL, git. Need to look into whether GIS is appropriate for handling maps
of floors (TODO: contact jbronn or malcolm). One of my group members insists I
invented the internet, rolling with it.

Motto: Never refresh, never surrender.
